<p><br></p><p><strong>Congrats for finishing the course.</strong></p><p>A frequently asked question is "Where to go from here?" A lot of 
developers want to further their knowledge by learning advanced Spring 
topics and practicing projects.</p><p>I've compiled a list of resources that you can use to get more information on Spring advanced features.

</p><p>Here's a free guide that walks you through the steps:</p><p><strong><em>The Ultimate Guide to Hosting a Java Web App with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

</strong>I want a solution for hiding customer id in URL. Maybe,change request from GET to POST?</p><p>-----</p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p>In the files below, look for modified code. Simply search for the text "luv2code: UPDATES".</p><p>Here's the basic approach.</p><p>For the links, change the table to use forms. There is a form for each row of data. The form would be setup to POST the data. Each row would have a unique button with the ID embedded. Apply special CSS to make the Submit button look like a hypertext link.</p><p>The controller request mappings will now support @PostMapping. This is for /showFormForUpdate and /delete</p><p>---</p><p><strong>Notes about the solution.</strong></p><p>Using the POST method does not add security. It simply "hides" the request data. But any web user can still easily see the data. All they have to do is use Chrome Dev Tools or FireFox Firebug. So, using POST is only giving you "security by obscurity" which is weak if you have highly sensitive data.</p><p>If you have highly sensitive data then you should use SSL encryption on your server and make use of Spring Security to protect sensitve web URLs in your app.</p><p>---<br></p><p>Having the customer ID in the URL is not a problem. The GET approach is a standard practice that is used in the industry. However the solution was provided based on student's request.</p><p>In our example, the ID is for customers ... but this could easily be a product ID. The important thing is the customer ID is not sensitive data.</p><p>If you check the major ecommerce sites like Amazon or Best Buy, the product ID is heavily used in the URL.</p><p>The URLs below are live URLs on production ecommerce systems that use product ID in the URL.</p><p>Amazon<br>- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DFKC2SO</p><p>BestBuy<br>- http://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-echo-dot/5578864.p?skuId=5578864</p><p>---<br></p><p><strong>Solution Source Code<br></strong></p><p>- <a href="https://gist.github.com/darbyluv2code/df856411a3e0c926a4654660045acda4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/darbyluv2code/df856411a3e0c926a4654660045acda4</a></p><p>======</p><p><strong>FAQ: Which more secure? GET or POST?</strong></p><p>Note, simply using the POST method does not add secure encryption. 
The data is still sent in the clear without any protection or 
encryption.</p><p>See this link:
